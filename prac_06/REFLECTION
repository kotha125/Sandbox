1.Iâ€™ve become more intentional about reading instructions carefully before starting.
2.I need to improve my time management and avoid leaving practicals and assignments until close to the deadline
3.I'm engaging actively with the practicals.
4.I need to stop skipping over error messages and instead take time to understand what they mean.
5.I think it would be helpful to have more real-life examples or projects, so we can see how the things we learn are used in the real world.
